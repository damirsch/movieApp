# Getting Started with my second project on React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Use this to run the application

### `npm run dev`

This command will start a local server on your PC so you can use the login feature, view your profile, add movies to your wishlist, etc.

In the serve/.env directory there is a link from my account to mongoDB. If you want, you can create your own cluster in Atlas and replace the link with your own
